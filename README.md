# World of Warcraft Classic: Mists of Pandaria
[World of Warcraft Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Classic "World of Warcraft Classic") is a version of the original [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/ "World of Warcraft") (WoW) game that was re-released by [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/ "Blizzard Entertainment") to hopes of recreating the experience of the game as it was in its early days. Blizzard has released several versions of Classic, each reflecting a different era of WoW:
- Classic Era: Based on version 1.12 (original game).
- [The Burning Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade "The Burning Crusade") Classic and [Wrath of the Lich King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King "Wrath of the Lich King") Classic: Followed as progression options.
- [Cataclysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm "Cataclysm") Classic: Most recently launched, reintroducing the fourth expansion.
  
[Mists of Pandaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria "Mists of Pandaria") (MoP) is the up and coming expansion to WoW classic. MoP was WoW’s most distinct and stylistically bold expansion. It introduced a new playable race and class, a beautifully crafted continent, and a more introspective story. Though met with skepticism early on, it’s now remembered as one of the game’s most well-rounded and polished expansions.

Recently, the classic team at Blizzard has decided to give players early-access to this expansion through the use of a public beta. In this public beta players are asked to test out their ideas and provide feedback to Blizzard in hopes to provide a more polished full-access experience. These ideas are asked to be tested in PvP arenas and battle ground as well as the expansion's introductory raid, Mogushan Vaults.
