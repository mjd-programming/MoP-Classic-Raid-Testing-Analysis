# World of Warcraft Classic: Mists of Pandaria
World of Warcraft Classic is a version of the original World of Warcraft (WoW) game that was re-released by Blizzard Entertainment to hopes of recreating the experience of the game as it was in its early days. Blizzard has released several versions of Classic, each reflecting a different era of WoW:
- Classic Era: Based on version 1.12 (original game).
- The Burning Crusade Classic and Wrath of the Lich King Classic: Followed as progression options.
- Cataclysm Classic: Most recently launched, reintroducing the fourth expansion.
  
Mists of Pandaria (MoP) is the up and coming expansion to WoW classic. MoP was WoW’s most distinct and stylistically bold expansion. It introduced a new playable race and class, a beautifully crafted continent, and a more introspective story. Though met with skepticism early on, it’s now remembered as one of the game’s most well-rounded and polished expansions.

Recently, the classic team at Blizzard has decided to give players early-access to this expansion through the use of a public beta. In this public beta players are asked to test out their ideas and provide feedback to Blizzard in hopes to provide a more polished full-access experience. These ideas are asked to be tested in PvP arenas and battle ground as well as the expansion's introductory raid, Mogushan Vaults.
